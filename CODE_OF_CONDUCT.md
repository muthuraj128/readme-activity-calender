# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of this project pledge to make participation in our community a respectful, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone. We commit to ensuring that everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, education level, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, religion, or sexual identity and orientation, feels welcome and safe.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Values 

We value creativity, curiosity, and kindness.  
We believe in mentoring newcomers and lifting each other up as we grow together.  
All contributors, whether beginners or experts, are welcome here.  
We encourage respectful dialogue and constructive feedback that helps us build a better open-source world.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including GitHub repositories, issue trackers, pull requests, discussions, and all communication mediums, as well as in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Examples of representing a project include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team at [fewinfos [at] gmail [dot] com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project team members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
