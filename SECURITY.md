# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to help improve the security of this project. We strive to maintain a safe, client-side experience for our users and appreciate responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.

## 🛡️ Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security issue in **GitHub Repo Stats Widget**, please follow these guidelines:

- 📧 Contact: fewinfos[at]gmail[dot]com
- 📦 Include detailed information such as:
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Screenshots or logs
  - Browser and OS used

Please avoid publicly disclosing the issue until we’ve had time to investigate and apply fixes.

We aim to respond within **48 hours** and address verified issues within **7 days**.

## 🔐 What to Report

This project is fully client-side, with no backend. Please focus reports on:
- 🕵️ Cross-site scripting (XSS) issues
- 🧪 Malicious injection via GitHub REST API responses
- 🛡️ Mishandling of user-supplied repo URLs
- 📊 Risks involving embedded visualizations (Chart.js)

Reports unrelated to security (e.g. feature requests, UI bugs) should be submitted via [GitHub Issues].

## 🔐 Disclosure Preference

Encrypted communication is available on request using GPG. Let us know if you’d like the public key.
